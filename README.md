# Pizzahut_Sales_SQL🍕🍕
Welcome to the Pizzahut_Sales_SQL project! This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to analyze and extract insights from the sales data of Pizzahut.
The project is divided into three levels of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.
Each level consists of questions that test different aspects of SQL proficiency, including data retrieval, aggregation, subqueries, and performance optimization.
In this project, I have worked on a dataset related to Pizzahut's sales operations.
The objective is to answer a series of business questions using efficient SQL queries.
The questions range from basic data retrieval to complex analytical queries, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of SQL capabilities.
Thank You👋
